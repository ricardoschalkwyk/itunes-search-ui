# How to Install

You will need to have the files on your local machine by by pulling it from `gitHub`.

Once it is on your local machine you will need to use you `command-line/terminal` to nagivate to the directory.

When in the directory you will need to type `npm install` for both `front-end` and `back-end` directories so that you install all neccesary node-modules.

Then if all modules are install in the `back-end` aswell as the `front-end` you can just type `npm start` in the seperate
directories.

The app will automatically open in your browser.

# How to use

Functionally this app can be used to search for anything from itunes.

On the user side you just have to type what you are looking for inside the search box,
there are also two select boxes.

The first box is for the `media type` that you want like music or a movie. `(Preset to all)`

The second box is for how many results you want.`(Preset to 10)`

## Pages

There are two displayed pages.

Page one is for the search functionality.

Page two is for favorites that you favorite by clicking the heart

# Security

There are no `API` keys used so security for that was not neccesary.

The `Helmet middleware` was added to the back-end for `security-related HTTP response headers`

# Test

Testing examples are provided in all test files

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
